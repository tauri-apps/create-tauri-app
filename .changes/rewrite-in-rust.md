Rewrote `create-tauri-app` in rust to make it accessible to all communities and not only Node.js, and now you can use `create-tauri-app` through `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `cargo` or directly through your shell using `powershell` or `bash`. Check out the [README.md](https://github.com/tauri-apps/create-tauri-app#create-tauri-app) for different ways to use it.
