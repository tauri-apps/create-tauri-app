'create-tauri-app': 'major'

- **Breaking Change**: Rewrite `create-tauri-app` from scratch, inspired by `create-vite`
- **Breaking Change**: `dominator`, `Clojure ` and `Angular` templates are removed for now and will be added in a later version.
- **Breaking Change**: `create-tauri-app` no longer uses other frameworks bootstrapping tools, so the generated templates are different than before and is based on `create-vite` templates.
